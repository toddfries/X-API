=attr rate_limit_sleep_code

A coderef, called to implement sleeping.  It takes a single parameter -
the number of seconds to sleep.  The default implementation is:

    sub { sleep shift }

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use X::API;

    my $client = X::API->new_with_options(
        traits => [ qw/ApiMethods RateLimiting/ ],
        %other_options,
    );

    # Use $client as normal

=head1 DESCRIPTION

X's API implements rate limiting in a 15-minute window, and
will serve up an HTTP 429 error if the rate limit is exceeded for
a window.  Applying this trait will give L<X::API> the ability
to automatically sleep as much as is needed and then retry a request
instead of simply throwing an exception.
